    <p>"Absolutely the most amazing, phenomenal spinach-artichoke dip on planet earth. I'm getting ready to make it for the Super Bowl because EVERY party we go to this is the #1 request. Like others we use sour cream instead of mayo. When you make the dip, before baking, it is pretty thick. But as it bakes all the cheeses just melt together and you are left with a creamy concoction of gooey goodness." â€” Joy Hopkins</p>
